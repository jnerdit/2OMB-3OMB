3OMB SHARE TOKEN 3SHARES
{% endembed %}

The 3OMB share token 3SHARES is one of the instruments used to measure the value of the 3OMB protocol health, shareholder trust, and most importantly the ability to maintain 3OMB close to peg.

During epoch expansions the protocol mints 3OMB and distributes it proportionally to all 3SHARES holders who have staked their tokens in the 3ROOM \*\*\*\* (BOARDROOM in 2OMB).

3SHARES holders have voting rights (governance) on proposals to improve the protocol and future use cases within the 3OMB ecosystem.

3SHARES has a **maximum total supply of 70000** tokens distributed as follows:

1. _Team Allocation:_ 4990 3SHARES vested linearly over 3 months
2. Initial mint: 10 3SHARES minted upon contract creation for initial pool
3. \_Remaining 65000 3\_SHARES are allocated for incentivizing Liquidity Providers in two shares pools for 12 months

3OMB 3BOND TOKEN
{% endembed %}

3OMB Bonds (3BOND) main job is to help incentivize changes in 3OMB supply during an epoch contraction period. When the TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of 3OMB falls below 1 FTM, 3BOND tokens are issued and can be bought with 3OMB at the current price. Exchanging 3OMB for 3BOND burns 3OMB tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helping to get the price back up to 1 FTM. These 3BOND can be redeemed for 3OMB when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg. This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for 3OMB when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward 1 FTM.

{% hint style="info" %}
Contrary to early algorithmic protocols, 3BOND do not have expiration dates.
{% endhint %}

All holders are able to redeem their 3BOND for 3OMB tokens as long as the Treasury has a positive 3OMB balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion periods.
