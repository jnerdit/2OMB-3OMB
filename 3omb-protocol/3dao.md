description: REBATES - A NEW TERM FOR BONDING ASSETS (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH 3BOND)
---

# 3DAO

### 3DAO is a deflationary pegging mechanism that supports both 2OMB and 3OMB protocols.

3DAO Rebates are enabled when **3OMB is at TWAP > 1.2 FTM**

{% hint style="success" %}
**The 3DAO will never issue bonded assets if the 3OMB TWAP is below 1.2**
{% endhint %}

3DAO allows for bonding assets.

* Bond Liquidity:
  * 3OMB-wFTM Spooky LP - 6000x multiplier
  * 2SHARES-wFTM Spooky LP - 12000x multiplier
* Bond Protocol Tokens:
  * 3SHARES - 5000x multiplier
  * 2SHARES - 10000x multiplier

By bonding these assets, all tokens are removed from circulation by burning them to the treasury.

At the price of each asset, you will receive the $USD amount of 3OMB based on the prices **at the time of bonding.**\
\
**The bonding premium % percentage represents the potential ROI (return on investment) at the current time of bonding.**

### Vesting

Your 3OMB reward tokens are **linearly** vested for 3 days.

3OMB reward tokens are replenished at the start of every epoch.
