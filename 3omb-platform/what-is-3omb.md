# ‚Åâ What is 3OMB?

{% hint style="info" %}
You may be trying to figure it all out - so what is the point of 3OMB? Why launch another FTM pegged token? Why didn't we just modify 2OMB? Whats the deal!?
{% endhint %}

#### Here is the TL;DR version

The [**2OMB**](https://2omb.finance) project started as an experiment, and we never imagined what such an outstanding success the project would become. After the first few few epochs passed, and everyone agreed that the protocol was working and renounced ownership of the 2OMB smart contracts. This means new implementations, modifications or upgrades are now not possible. That being the case, the innovative new ideas and solutions that were developed after the contract deployment, could not be "added to 2OMB" - this is just the nature of blockchain.&#x20;

Protocol changes and solutions implemented in 3OMB include:

* Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL)&#x20;

The 2OMB protocol works exceptionally well - however, the speed/emission rate is four times (4x) that of the typical 1 year design used in these protocols. We have noticed a commonality among Seigniorage projects, and that is volatility caused by large amounts of LP moving on/off the pools by whales. We have devised a platform with mechanics that allow 3OMB will retro-actively with 2OMB  Your 2OMB/ 2SHARES will be usable on the 3OMB protocol. They compliment each other, and even after 2SHARES stops emissions on 4.03.2022, the 3OMB protocol will help it retain value.

3OMB has designed a new protocol. Using parts and functionality that worked well in 2OMB, as well as some other great projects, we have designed an innovative new bonding system. With 3OMB we implement our new bonding mechanism, using an algorithm that will replace the traditional bonds system.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
2OMB will still rely on the traditional bond mechanics (2BOND)
{% endhint %}

If 3OMB falls below peg, the algorithm kicks in and the protocol(contract)  starts a buyback phase that continues until 3OMB is back above 1:1 peg to FTM. The funds for this come from the 3DAO Treasury. . The 3DAO will create protocol owned liquidity regulating the price of 3omb, thus keeping it above bond.
