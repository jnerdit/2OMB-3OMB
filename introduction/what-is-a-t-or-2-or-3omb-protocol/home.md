## We need a bigger picture frame

The $3OMB algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed at bringing liquidity, hedging, and new use cases and opportunities. These protocols/tokens help OPERA network users really get the most out of the chains' coolest, yet not talked about enough - and that is the native "Liquid Staking" of FTM on the network validator nodes\
\
The new protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $3OMB supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $FTM. For $3OMB specifically, both parts of this mechanism are now both automated. The 3OMB protocol has replaced the traditional bond system that normally kicks in when the TWAP falls under 1:1 peg to FTM. Normally, BONDS are issued, and offered for first come first serve to swap T|2|3OMB for T|2|3BOND at a 1:1 ratio. This created buy pressure on the stablecoin and helps push it back up above peg. This process however requires users to actually participate in the BOND swap/redemption. As you have seen, sometimes it takes quite some time to achieve peg again.

We figured we let a smart contract automatically start a buyback/burn that will increase in rate/value until peg is maintained. 2OMB <--> 3OMB--> 3DAO&#x20;

Inspired by the original idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors (bDollar and soup), 3OMB is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following two tokens:\
\- 3OMB ($3OMB).\
\- 3SHARES ($3SHARES)

## What differentiates 3OMB from other algorithmic tokens?

Unlike previous algorithmic tokens, $3OMB is not pegged to a stable coin‚Äî it is instead pegged to $FTM. \
\
Why is this?\
\
3OMB believes in the potential of Fantom Opera, and has chosen to align its mission to both provide value to and derive value from Fantom's future growth. In addition to existing and future use cases such as FTMPad, $3OMB aims to become the main medium of exchange on Fantom Opera. This will be realized and achieved by providing a mirrored, liquid asset to $FTM.&#x20;

One of the primary shortcomings of past algorithmic tokens has been a lack of use cases, leaving no good reason for somebody to want to use or hold them. In order to successfully maintain the peg in the long-run, the 3OMB team will maintain a focus on innovation around enhanced functionality and use cases.
