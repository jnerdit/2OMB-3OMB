Q: When I try to buy BONDS on the 3DAO there is no more 3OMB available - what gives? A: At the beggining of every 3OMB EPOCH, a set limited amount of 3OMB will be allocated for bonding, first come first serve basis until all sold. Often they sellout fast, so if you keep missing them, pay attention to the EPOCH times!

Q: How do I stake my LP in an Autocompounder? A: You can stake your LP tokens in; Beluga Finace: https://Beluga.fi YieldWolf: Feeder Finance: Beefy:

What the vault does is, instead of claiming rewards and dumping them for more of the 2OMB-FTM LPs, it LPs them into 2SHARE-FTM.

This is staked in the 2SHARE-FTM vault + reward users with deposits into the 2SHARE-FTM vault

Q: What kinds of pools, stakes, or autocompounder are the best for me? A: We can't really answer that, DYOR and make best descions that feel right and that make you gains

Q: What's different between staking 2omb and 3omb? A:

I have questions about what happens after April 3..

My understanding is that 2SHARE will be at Max Supply, no more printing A: The BOARDROOM will still print 2OMB, but no new 2SHARES will ever be minted, as all 65,000 of them will be minted by or around, the end of April 3rd

Q: Will 2SHARE continue to print 2OMB? A: Yes - the BOARDROOM will print 2OMB as long as 2OMB is above peg, and has shares staked in it.

Q: If there's no longer any 2SHARE being printed, what will be the 2OMB ecosystem LP rewards? will the LP 2omb-FTM and others in the 2omb ecosystem stop providing APRs?\* A: 3omb has farms for 2omb and 2shares LP tokens (so liquidity will remain in 2omb pools but rewards will be given in 3shares)\*

Q: if the whole 2omb eco. rely on the 3OMB eco. to survive isn't logical that the transfer of liquidity will move from 2omb eco. to 3omb eco.? A: Eventually, there will be a shift. However, 2OMB holders will be incentivized to eventually sell to the POL at a premium.

Q: Now i get the 2share buy back by the treasury and burned, buy backs at 50% above market value. So I guess no one will buy anymore 2share A: Incorrect. In fact the opposite will be true, as 2SHARES becomes increasingly scarce, and demand will be strong because of the premium to be made,

Q4: And finally, how does TOMB fit in all of this? A: Stay tuned for more on that!
