**Q: What happens after April 3. Can I still stake my 2SHARES after they have all been minted?                                                                                                                                                                                                 A: The BOARDROOM will still print 2OMB, but no new 2SHARES will ever be minted, as all 65,000 of them will be minted by the end of April 3rd 2022.**

**Q: Will 2SHARES BOARDROOM continue to print 2OMB?                                                                                        A: Yes! BOARDROOM will print 2OMB as long as 2OMB is above peg, and has shares staked in it.**

A: No! 3OMB has farms for 2OMB and 2SHARES LP tokens (so liquidity will remain in 2OMB pools but rewards will be given in 3SHARES.**

**Q: if the whole 2OMB ecosystem relies on the 3OMB ecosystem to survive, isn't logical that the transfer of liquidity will move from 2OMB to 3OMB?                                                                                                              A: Eventually 2SHARES will become so scarce that the 3OMB 3DAO will offer juicy premiums for 2SHARES, so 2OMB holders will be incentivized to eventually sell to the POL.**

**Q: Now with the 2SHARES buy-back/burn, no one will buy anymore 2SHARES so wont price tank?                                                                                                                                                                                                         A: Incorrect. In fact the opposite will be true, as 2SHARES becomes increasingly scarce, and demand will be strong because of the premium to be made.**

**Q: And finally, how does TOMB fit in all of this?                                                                                                                      A: Stay tuned for more on that!**
