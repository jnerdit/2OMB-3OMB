## Why 3OMB?

Why have a token that’s pegged to the price of $FTM when you could just use $FTM itself instead?

Good question!\
\
But before we dive into what $3OMB could mean for you as an investor, let’s break down the potential impact of $3OMB and it's role in helping the long-term success of the Fantom ecosystem as a whole.

For Fantom to continue running as the fast, secure, and cost-effective blockchain we all know and love, its validator nodes will continue to rely on its $FTM token remaining staked and locked up, in increasing amounts over time as the number of validators on the network grows.\
\
FTM is distributed as a reward to all validator nodes, which will continue to increase in number to sustain the network's growth. However, the $FTM token itself has a fixed total with a maximum supply of 3.175 billion tokens. At the time of writing this, the staking requirement for a validator node requires 1,000,000 $FTM (soon to be voted down to 100,000 FTM) to be locked into that node for its lifespan. Additionally, people can 'Delegate' any amount of FTM to be locked onto the node for 14-365 days to earn passive income.&#x20;

As of 2.08.2022;

* 1,348,136,212 FTM (51% of Circulating Supply) Locked in Validator Nodes
* 2,657,587,186 FTM (Circulating Supply)
* 3,175,000,000 FTM (Maximum Supply)

So if $FTM is intended to be viable as a cheap, fast, decentralized alternative to Ethereum and others, what will happen when there just isn’t enough Opera-native $FTM to go around?

If $3OMB succeeds in holding the peg, this will create a mirrored, liquid asset that can be moved around and traded without restrictions, all while benefiting from the price appreciation of the native $FTM token. Reaching the peg and holding the peg is crucial, and this will ultimately be what drives the value of $3OMB for investors. In the short term, this would mean attractive APRs for liquidity providers on what would _essentially_ be a stable pair.

So, once a liquid market is established, what happens next? What are some other reasons you’d want to hold $3OMB?

$3OMB aims to become a major player in driving liquidity for the current ecosystem, and to become the new standard for DAO and algorithmic stablecoins in the future. The next generation of Fantom DeFi projects will be incentivized and leveraged by those who participate in projects like T|2|3OMB Finance.

### _1.“I keep seeing that 3OMB will solve Fantom Opera's liquidity issues, but I don't fully understand what that means or its implications.”_

You may have read that by pegging to $FTM, $3OMB hopes to become a highly liquid, mirrored asset. What does this actually mean though?

As an example, say the dollar is the world's main medium of exchange. Everything is measured in terms of dollars, whether that's your weekly salary, or whether it's the price of bread or a computer. And you need dollars to buy literal gas to get to the bakery, or to the computer store.&#x20;

But imagine if nobody wanted to use their dollars, and preferred to keep them under their mattresses instead. Since the value of everything gravitates in relation to the dollar, there would need to be something out there that is 1:1 "interchangeable" with the dollar, so that even if all the dollars in the world were tucked under mattresses, people could continue to transact freely.

Knowing that whatever they received would be able to be traded in for a dollar at whatever point in time they so desired. That's what $3OMB hopes to become for $FTM.

## Getting Started

### 1.“Generally speaking, what's the easiest flow to follow for compounding rewards?”

{% hint style="danger" %}
The following is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. It is for educational and entertainment purposes only.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

There are countless strategies, and which one you choose depends on your risk tolerance and short, medium, and long-term goals. That being said, the "plug-and-play" method is detailed below. Also, take some profits along the way. Don't get too greedy.

**If $3OMB is OVER the peg:**

\-Buy $3OMB and pair it with $FTM to provide liquidity, and stake your 3OMB-wFTM LP in the farm to earn $3SHARES rewards.\
\-Take your $3SHARES rewards and stake them in the 3ROOM to earn inflationary $3OMB rewards.\
\-Sell half of your earned $3OMB for $FTM, and compound it back into the 3OMB-FTM LP.\
\-Profit!

#### **If $3OMB is UNDER the peg:**

* Buy 3OMB and exchange it for 3BOND. If you are  providing LP, you can break the LP to exchange $3OMB for $3BOND, and use the remaining $FTM to buy $3OMB to also exchange for $3BOND. Now you have a big fat bag of $3BOND, and you've also helped bring $3OMB back above peg so that we can resume printing.
* Sell $3BOND for a redemption bonus once $3OMB is back over peg.
* Profit from swap\


### 2. "What is 50/50?"

50/50 is the method best suited to provide stability for both the platform and for your underlying investment. By boosting liquidity, the 50/50 strategy reduces price volatility, and helps $3OMB stay above the peg for longer to keep the Boardroom printing. This, in turn, attracts new investors and keeps the ecosystem growing. \
\
1\)When you claim your $3OMB rewards in the Boardroom, sell 50% of them for $FTM. \
\
&#x20;2\)When you go to provide 3OMB-FTM LP,  stake the entirety of your remaining 3OMB with the $FTM you've just purchased.&#x20;

### 3.“There's so many auto-compounding vaults, what should I do?”

If you are in a $3OMB-FTM LP auto-compounding vault, you are creating buy pressure on $3OMB. If you are in a $3SHARE-FTM LP auto-compounding vault and you also hold $3SHARE elsewhere, the auto-compounding vault will be suppressing its price since it is continuously selling $2SHARE. &#x20;

(**Please Note**: Always proceed with caution. We **DO NOT** recommend putting more than 5% of what you are staking on 3omb into a single auto compounder. Defi involves significant risks and users should manage risks accordingly. For example, users should only put in what they are willing to lose. **DO NOT** invest your life savings and do your homework before getting active in Defi.)



### &#x20;Terms and Mechanisms

### 1. "What is an expansionary epoch?"

&#x20;**** An expansionary epoch is the amount of $3OMB that is printed by $3SHARE in order to increase the total circulating supply.

To simplify the explanation with a hypothetical example, let’s say an epoch is 3 days long and there are $100 dollars in the circulating supply.

&#x20;If the money printer grows the supply by 10% of the existing circulating supply each day, at the end of the 3 days you'd have 100\*1.1\*1.1\*1.1 = $133.

&#x20;Then, let’s say the emissions decrease to 5% per day.

&#x20;You’d then have have $133 \*1.05 \*1.05 \*1.05 = $153 at the end of this second epoch.

### **2. “What is compounding in the context of 3OMB?”**

Earning a return on gains you've already made from previous periods is what is commonly referred to as compounding.

&#x20;For example, consider a 3% daily APR on an initial investment of $100.

&#x20;After 24 hours it would grow to $103.

&#x20;After 365 days without compounding: $1195.

&#x20;After 365 days, compounding once daily: $4,848,272.

## 3ROOM/BOARDROOM

### **1. What happens if I interact with the 3ROOM/BOARDROOM in any way?**

{% hint style="danger" %}
Any interaction with the boardroom will reset both timers. That's 1 epochs (6 hours) to withdraw your 3OMB rewards, and 2 epochs to unstake your 3SHARES (12 hours).
{% endhint %}

### **2. Are the 3ROOM/BOARDROOM rewards pro-rated by time? I.E. if I stake three hours before the end of an epoch vs. five hours before the end of an epoch, do I get different rewards?**

No, it's determined by how much you have staked at the time of printing (i.e. end of one epoch and start of the other). It doesn't matter if you stake 3 hours before or 30 seconds before the emissions occur.

### 3. If I remove my SHARES from 3ROOM/BOARDROOM without first collecting my 2|3OMB, will it be lost forever?

No, it will still be there to collect whenever you need.

### 4. The Boardroom APR dropped because we're in a 'debt phase.' What does this mean?

A debt phase takes place on the expansion epochs that start after a contraction period where there are still 2|3BOND to be redeemed.

65% of Expansion during Debt Phase is allocated to the Treasury Fund to prepare for the 2BOND Redemption. This amount is still reserved  whether or not 2|3BOND holders are redeeming bonds or not.

Once 2|3OMB in treasury is sufficiently full to meet all circulating bond redemption, expansion rates will resume to normal.

### 6. If we're in a debt phase, how long will it last until Boardroom continues printing as normal?

The debt phase will last as long as is necessary to adequately pay back outstanding $2BOND debt. Please keep in mind that the DAO will also need to collect a little extra, as there needs to be a cushion to cover the bonuses when people redeem 2/3BOND over peg.\
\
There's no exact way of calculating how many epochs it takes, since we don't know exactly when people will redeem their $2BOND. If the debt phase is ended too early, and then the treasury doesn't have enough $2OMB to repay the $2BOND bonus, then the APR restriction would need to be turned back on.

### 7. At the end of the epoch, the Boardroom did not print $2OMB, and then no $2BOND(s) were issued in the pit. Why?

There is a balanced state "at peg" when the $2OMB TWAP is between 1.00 and 1.01, and this means there is neither contraction nor inflation.

### 8. If 2OMB continues climbing above the price of the peg, will that influence how long the debt epoch lasts?

Depending on the price of 3OMB, the Boardroom print will have to adjust to provide a buffer for any unclaimed 2BOND. As the price of 2OMB climbs above the peg, more 2OMB needs to be distributed to the treasury to account for 2BOND bonus redemption.

## Ecosystem Partners

### 1.“How do auto-compounding vaults work?”

Staking either $2OMB/$FTM or $2SHARE/$FTM LPs in these vaults rewards you with more of the same LP (liquidity pool) tokens that you have deposited. They deposit your LP tokens in the same yield farms that are available to everyone on $2OMB, and then, every set amount of minutes, they harvest the $2SHARE that you’ve earned, sell a portion of if, and use the proceeds to mint more LP tokens on SpookySwap, before finally depositing those LP tokens back into the $2OMB pools, growing your allocation. \


You can actually do this yourself if you prefer not to have to pay fees; it’s simply a service offered as a time-saver for those that don’t want the hassle of going through the whole process themselves all day every day.\


&#x20;Note on the tokenomics of auto-compounding: Both the $2SHARE/FTM LP and the $2OMB/$FTM LP pools pay rewards in $2SHARE: If you’re in the $2SHARE/$FTM pool, 50% of your $2SHARE rewards are sold for $FTM each time the protocol auto-compounds. If you’re in the $2OMB/$FTM pool, 100% of your reward is sold and used to purchase half $2OMB and half $FTM each time. Unlike the 2OMB/FTM vault, the 2SHARE/FTM vault does not put any buy pressure on $2OMB.\


### 2. "Where else can I use my $2OMB?"

Currently, you can find various rewarded $2OMB pairs on YieldWolf, Beluga Finance, and Beefy.



## Core Values

### 1. “I'm invested in the project for the long term, and I feel guilty taking profits. Am I still a team player if I move profits somewhere outside of the project?”

Never put all your funds in one basket, even if it's $2OMB. Always take gains along the way. The 2omb team views it as a success if, over time, everyone gets their initial investment back into their wallets and continues investing with the profits that come after that.
