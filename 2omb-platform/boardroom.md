* **2OMB rewards claim** will lock staked 2SHARES for 2 epochs and the next 2OMB rewards can only be claimed 1 EPOCH later
*   Distribution of 2OMB during **Expansion**

    **100%** as rewards for Boardroom stakers\
    **0%** goes to DAO fund

    **0%** goes to DEV fund

### Boardroom Dashboard Information <a href="#masonry-ui-available-information" id="masonry-ui-available-information"></a>

**Next Epoch:** Time remaining until end of current epoch. As **** indicated by the countdown timer.  Counting down the time until to the next epoch when it resets. (The duration of each epoch is 6 hours)

**Current Epoch:** This number represents the current epoch and how many epochs have passed since project launched

**2OMB Price (TWAP):** The price of 2OMB relative to FTM, this is the current **peg ratio**. Ex. if this number is 1.5 - this would indicate a 1 2OMB = 1.5 FTM (1:1.5)

**APR: R**efers to the simple returns in USD value relative to the amount of 2SHARES staked (USD value). _Note: **** APR fluctuates from time to time and is dependent on certain factors such as:_

* Price of 2OMB
* Price of 2SHARES
* Amount of 2SHARES staked in Masonry (Locked Value)

**2SHARES Staked:** This number represents the total amount of 2SHARES currently staked in the Boardroom.&#x20;

### Contraction Periods <a href="#masonry-on-contraction-periods" id="masonry-on-contraction-periods"></a>

{% hint style="warning" %}
Boardroom will **not** mint any 2OMB while TWAP < 1.01 (_NO REWARDS ON BOARDROOM_)
{% endhint %}

### :moneybag:Debt Phase <a href="#masonry-on-debt-phase" id="masonry-on-debt-phase"></a>

A Debt Phase takes place on the Expansion epochs that _**start after a**_ _**Contraction Period  and where there are still 2BOND to be redeemed**_. 65% of the normal Expansion rate (2OMB emission/supply) during a Debt Phase is allocated to the Treasury to prepare for 2BOND Redemption. This amount is still reserved whether or not 2BOND holders are redeeming bonds or not.&#x20;

Once the amount of 2OMB in the Treasury is sufficient to meet all circulating bond redemption, the expansion rates will return to normal.
