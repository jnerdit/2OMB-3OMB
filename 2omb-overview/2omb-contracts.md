2OMB token is designed to be used as a medium of exchange. The built-in stability mechanism in the protocol aims to maintain 2OMB peg to 1 Fantom (FTM) token in the long run.

As the 2OMB share token, $2SHARES are one of the ways to measure the value of the 2OMB Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain 2OMB close to peg. During epoch expansions, the protocol mints 2OMB and distributes it proportionally to all 2SHARES holders who have staked their tokens in the BOARDROOM. 2SHARES holders have voting rights (governance) on proposals to improve the protocol and future use cases within the 2OMB finance ecosystem. 2SHARES has a **maximum total supply of 70000** tokens distributed as follows:

1. 1._Team Allocation:_ 4990 2SHARES vested linearly over 3 months
2. 2.Initial mint: 10 2SHARES minted upon contract creation for initial pool
3. 3.\_Remaining 65000 2\_SHARES are allocated for incentivizing Liquidity Providers in two shares pools for 4 months

## 2BOND - 2OMB BONDS <a href="#2bond-2omb-bonds" id="2bond-2omb-bonds"></a>

2BOND is issued when 2OMB falls below peg, and the bond mechanic is a way to help incentivize changes in 2OMB supply during an epoch contraction period. When the TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of 2OMB falls below 1 FTM, 2BOND are issued and can be bought with 2OMB at the current price. Exchanging 2OMB for 2BOND burns 2OMB tokens, taking them out of circulation (deflation) and helping to get the price back up to 1 FTM. These 2BOND can be redeemed for 2OMB when the price is above peg in the future, plus an extra incentive for the longer they are held above peg. This amounts to inflation and sell pressure for 2OMB when it is above peg, helping to push it back toward 1 FTM.

{% hint style="info" %}
Contrary to early algorithmic protocols, 2BOND tokens do not have expiration dates.
{% endhint %}

All holders are able to redeem their 2BOND for 2OMB tokens as long as the Treasury has a positive 2OMB balance, which typically happens when the protocol is in epoch expansion periods.
