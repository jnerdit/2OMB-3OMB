# ðŸ’° Auto Compounding

### Manual Compounding

You can also deposit your LP tokens on 2|3OMB directly. Head over to [**FARMS** ](https://2omb.finance/farms)**/** [**3FARM**](https://3omb.finance/farms) \*\*\*\* and chose the farm you want to enter. Approve the token on the website by clicking on "Approve" and wait for tx confirmation. The click on the + button and enter the amount of LP tokens you want to deposit.

Compounding manually You can compound your rewards manually, by claiming your tokens and repeating the steps from Creating Liquidity. See Strategies for more details.

### How do auto-compounding vaults work?

Staking either 2|3OMB-wFTM or 2|3SHARES-wFTM LP in the various vaults rewards you with more of the same LP (liquidity pool) tokens that you have deposited. They deposit your LP tokens in the same yield farms that are available to everyone on $2OMB, and then, every set amount of minutes, they harvest the 2|3SHARES that youâ€™ve earned, sell a portion of if, and use the proceeds to mint more LP tokens on SpookySwap, before finally depositing those LP tokens back into the 2|3OMB pools, growing your allocation.

You can actually do this yourself if you prefer not to have to pay fees; itâ€™s simply a service offered as a time-saver for those that donâ€™t want the hassle of going through the whole process themselves all day every day.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note on the tokenomics of auto-compounding: Both the 2|3SHARES-wFTM LP and the 2|3OMB-wFTM LP pools pay rewards in SHARES: If youâ€™re in the 2|3SHARES-wFTM pool, 50% of your SHARES rewards are sold for $FTM each time the protocol auto-compounds. If youâ€™re in the 2|3OMB-wFTM pool, 100% of your reward is sold and used to purchase half 2|3OMB and half FTM each time it compounds.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike the 2|3OMB-wFTM LP Vault, a 2|3SHARES-wFTM LP Vault does not put any buy pressure on 2|3OMB, and creates sell pressure on the 2|3SHARES.
